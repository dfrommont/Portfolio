                <p className="text-start text-light" style={{width: "75%"}}>I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Sussex and I'm in the second year of my course (<i>MComp with placement year</i>)</p><br />
                <p className="text-start text-light" style={{width: "75%"}}>In my personal life I enjoy cooking, particularly making and eating my own home-made pasta, playing video games and indoor rock climbing. Whilst I've always enjoyed cooking, rock climbing is a new hobby I've discovered since coming to university - both for it's exercise and the social aspect as many of people I know also enjoy climbing.</p><br />
                <p className="text-start text-light" style={{width: "75%"}}>My motivation to study Computer Science comes from my intersts in gaming, mathematics and engineering. Before coming to university, I studied Computer Science, Physics and Maths at A-level and in secondary school, I got to take part in STEM outreach events that saw me visiting various colleges and universities in the south of the UK.</p><br />
                <p className="text-start text-light" style={{width: "75%"}}>I chose to study at the University of Sussex as it's a great University for my course, was recommended by relatives, it's nearby to Brighton - a town I associate with as a young gay man. I have since come to love the madness of living in a city like Brighton.</p>
